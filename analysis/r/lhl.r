# This is an improved version of lhl_old. It is just marginally faster, but
# cleaner and more intuitive. It sets first all possible combinations of s1
# and s2 (start and stop), then it computes the differences between the overall
# rate r and the state rates r1, r2 and r3, weighted by their respective
# durations t1, t2 and t3. Then it computes the index (i.e., an integer of the
# position in the vector) at which the differences were maximized, with which
# all other metrics can be solved. 
# inputs:
#        - r_times: every time at which there was a response
#        - trial_duration: the duration of peal trial
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Vector of putative stops (except the first)

  # Get all combinations of s1 and s2 with s1 less than s2.
  #   For example, if s1 can be 1, 2, 3, and s2 = 2, 3, 4, 
  #   the combinations are (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)

    # with duration 0!
